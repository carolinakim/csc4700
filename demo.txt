What is your favorite movie?
Room (2015)

If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
I would go to South Korea since that is where my family is from, but I've never been there.

If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
Probably some kind of power that would allow me to conjure up random stuff I need. Like randomly creating a money tree or something with a super power...
